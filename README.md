# crud-used-php-with-mysqli
This is a final project for class 11 exams at SMK Taruna Bangsa Kota Bekasi, this code is inspired by the site https://www.malasngoding.com/
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are basic operations used in database manipulation. In the context of developing web applications using the PHP programming language and MySQLi database technology, here is a description of CRUD:

- Create: This operation aims to add new data to the database. In PHP and MySQLi, the Create operation is performed using the SQL INSERT INTO command. For example, adding new user data to the "users" table.
- Read: This operation is used to read or retrieve data from the database. The Read operation is performed using the SQL SELECT command. For example, reading a list of all users from the "users" table.
- Update: This operation functions to update existing data in the database. The Update operation is performed with the SQL UPDATE command. For example, updating a user's email address in the "users" table.
- Delete (Delete): This operation is used to delete data from the database. The Delete operation is performed with the SQL DELETE command. For example, deleting certain user data from the "users" table.

And I implemented all of that using the PHP programming language and using the MYSQLI Database and managing it using PhpMyAdmin
I hope this code can be useful for my juniors and all people who are learning CRUD using PHP.
